    <h2>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h2>
    <p class="about-text">
      ETERNOS was born from the belief that true style transcends time. In a
      world of fleeting trends, we create garments that embody permanence,
      mystery, and undeniable elegance. Each piece is designed to exist beyond
      the constraints of seasons and eras, crafted for those who dare to embrace
      the eternal.

    <h2>THE ETERNAL VISION</h2>
    <p class="about-text">
      Founded in the shadows of conventional fashion, ETERNOS emerged as a
      sanctuary for those seeking something deeper than mere clothing. We blend
      darkness with sophistication, creating a unique aesthetic that speaks to
      the soul. Our designs are not just worn—they are experienced, felt, and
      lived.
